# Investigation

The investigation into the threat actor associated with DPRK activities has revealed several interesting insights into how to track this actor's activity based on their own presentation on GitHub. This analysis allowed us to identify their context through their followers and following patterns within two to three degrees of separation. Additionally, it was found that the use of certain images can also be a key aspect when analyzing these networks related to this actor

# How to Identify a Suspicious GitHub Account Associated with DPRK Threat Actors
We can also identify a GitHub account based on its actual context - such as country, connections, social networks, and social activity - and analyze its relationships within that context, including follower and following patterns.

*When analyzing an account to determine if it might be related to a group threat actor like Lazarus, it's essential to consider the following aspects:*

- Creation Date: Many accounts were created between May and the end of 2023, exhibiting sporadic or unusual repository activity. However, there have also been instances where stolen accounts are used or purchased from other actors operating on GitHub who offer these services.
  
- Follow/Followers: These accounts are often interconnected, frequently following "node" accounts that serve as hubs within the network. Examine the follower and following patterns up to 2 or 3 degrees to identify any anomalies within their immediate context.
  
- Suspicious Repository Activity: Common patterns include excessive forking, starring empty profiles, hosting identical repositories, and sharing similar "projects."
  
- Many profiles tend to feature generic descriptions, such as "Full Stack Developer" with "+5 to +8 years of experience." Additionally, it's common to see broken social media links or profiles that overly promote their social media presence, which seems unusual.
  
- Personality: Most of these profiles lack a distinct identity and are not highly personalized. Many descriptions and organizational structures on their GitHub profiles appear identical or generic
  
- Skills: Frequently listed skills include "Full Stack Blockchain Developer," "Full-Stack Software Engineer," "AI/ML Engineer," and "Senior AI & Full Stack Developer."
  
- Social Networks: Indicators of inactivity include LinkedIn profiles with minimal engagement, fake GitHub profiles linked to legitimate accounts, suspicious Instagram/Facebook accounts, and a general lack of recent social activity.
  
- Context: Red flags include broken links, irregular GitHub statistics, AI-generated profile images, profiles based in Latin America with seemingly mismatched Asian appearances, and accounts lacking historical data.
  
- Logical Pattern: Activities unrelated to the account's stated purpose, mismatched skill sets, and inconsistencies in knowledge domains.
  
- Internal Association: Connections to specific organizations, interest in certain groups, and a pattern of forking projects tied to particular organizations-companies.
  
- External Association: The presence of these accounts on other social networks or freelance platforms like Upwork, and connections to associated accounts that engage in freelance work.

This approach could also help in identifying suspicious accounts by highlighting key characteristics and connections within their network

# How some accounts related to this suspicious campaing look like? 

Based on our investigation, we have identified certain patterns in the creation of these accounts, such as creation dates, skills, similar images in profiles, comparable bios, and analogous GitHub handles, among other aspects. 

Regarding their self-identification through images, we have found and classified their accounts based on how they present themselves.

Some aspects to consider in this image classification:

- It is clear that not all accounts using some of these images are connected to the campaign of suspicious GitHub accounts associated with DPRK threat actors.
  
- "Superstar" is a name they consistently use in their campaign (GitHub handle, profile images, text found) and this has been repeatedly observed among them.
  
- We found that these profiles, which have a substantial following, often tend to identify themselves with images featuring the number one, frequently complemented by gold and red colors and stars.
  
- There are also profile images linked to anime, movies, and other themes, where these accounts are interconnected. Furthermore, these profiles are commonly found among the followers of these accounts.
  
- While there is a diverse range of images, many accounts follow the pattern of presenting themselves as "developers" while aligning with a specific image.
