# Reviewing the activity of GitHub accounts associated with Lazarus - SuperStar

# Investigation

Investigating the suspicious activity in GitHub associated with the Lazarus Group, targeting developers and companies. The findings were published on Medium

The aim of this research was to demonstrate that the previously mentioned GitHub accounts, similar to those identified in earlier studies, appear to be expanding. They seem to be attempting to create more organic profiles by associating with organizations and engaging with other accounts.

# Introduction: The Unique Aspects of Investigating on GitHub

Today, a wide range of social networks and communication platforms exist, each serving a unique purpose and community. Many social networks have specific focuses, such as photo sharing, fitness tracking, or gaming, which shape the platform's features and functionality.

GitHub, while primarily a code repository, also exhibits social networking characteristics that facilitate communication and collaboration among developers. However, its core functionalities are centered around code management, version control, and collaborative development, distinguishing it from traditional social networks. 

GitHub’s unique structure and interaction model foster a distinct type of community, centered around collaboration and code sharing. Unlike traditional social platforms, GitHub’s community forms organically through contributions, pull requests, and issue discussions on open-source projects. This interaction style encourages knowledge sharing, peer review, and collective problem-solving, creating a collaborative environment that is both technical and community-driven. 

GitHub’s emphasis on building and refining code, rather than traditional socializing, makes it a fascinating platform for analyzing the unique networks and communities that form around it. Activities such as building community, connecting with others, and collaborating on projects all unfold in ways specific to GitHub, requiring users to engage through meaningful contributions rather than typical social interactions.

Our investigation focuses on how DPRK actors attempt to integrate and interact within the GitHub community. By leveraging behavioral and network analysis, we’re developing an advanced approach to identify these accounts and understand their strategies. This specialized analysis enables us to spot unusual patterns and maintain the integrity of this developer-driven platform.

The accounts listed here are part of an investigation into malicious actors on GitHub. Much of this activity, related to fake recruiters and employees, has been primarily associated with the Lazarus Group.

Most accounts were manually scraped, with specific characteristics filtered, such as:

- Creation date: account creation, repo activity, (Many of these accounts have been created at the end of 2023)

- Follow/Follower: these accounts follow each other like a network, following "node" type accounts

- Suspicious repository activity: "forker", "stars other empty profiles", identical repositories, same "projects"

- Bio: many of these profiles have similar descriptions: "Full Stack developer" "+5 years experience" , broken social network links

- Skills: most common skills are "Full Stack Blockchain Developer", " full-stack software engineer", "AI / ML Engineer" "Senior AI & Full Stack Developer"

- Social networks: LinkedIn account with no activity/like activity, fake github profiles linked to real accounts, suspicious instagram/facebook, no recent social activity

- Context: Accounts with broken links, github stats, AI-generated images, profiles in Latin America with an Asian appearance, accounts with no history

- Logical pattern: activity not related to account, knowledge scope, skill-set, 

- Internal association: joined organizations? what organizations is interested? forked focus on some organizations? 

- External Association: is this account on other social networks? Or from companies that hire like: up work? Do associated accounts do freelance?

# Details

This investigation is part of a series of investigations into suspicious activity on GitHub and LinkedIn involving recruiters and developers that is generally related to tactics and methods attributed to the Lazarus Group

There is a network of GitHub accounts tied to threat actors associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), used for social engineering, which we will refer to as the ‘SuperStar Campaign’. This name stems from findings and self-references within the network of accounts.


# Key:

- This research highlights the ongoing evolution of activities linked to DPRK threat actors, leading to the establishment of more organic and credible profiles.
- This evolution is reflected in the creation of “organizations” that appear to centralize commands, allowing for the development of a more realistic façade.
- The term “SuperStar” is frequently used among these accounts, which led us to coin it as a name for this network of GitHub accounts associated with the activities of threat actors related to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).
- A profile referenced in our previous investigation has been confirmed by the Unit42 research intelligence team as belonging to a campaign in which they pose as recruiters to install malware on the devices of job seekers in the tech industry. They refer to this activity as the CL-STA-240 Contagious Interview campaign.
