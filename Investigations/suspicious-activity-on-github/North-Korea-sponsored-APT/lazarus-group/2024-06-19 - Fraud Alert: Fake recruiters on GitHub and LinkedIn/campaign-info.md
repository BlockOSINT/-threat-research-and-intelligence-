# Source

The accounts listed here are part of an investigation into malicious actors on GitHub. Much of this activity, related to fake recruiters and employees, has been primarily associated with the Lazarus Group.

The accounts were manually scraped, filtering certain characteristics such as:

- Creation date

- (Follow/Follower): these accounts follow each other like a network

- Bio: many of these profiles have similar descriptions

- Context: Accounts with broken links, AI-generated images, profiles in Latin America with an Asian appearance, and accounts with no history.

# Update

It has been confirmed that the user "Onder Kayabasi" is connected to the Lazarus Group, as previously reported:

unit42.paloaltonetworks linked him to the CL-STA-240 Contagious Interview campaign
- In this campaign, the attackers targeted job-seeking individuals on LinkedIn, luring them to download and execute malware that masquerades as a legitimate video call application. This campaign is a continuation of activity we initially reported in November 2023.
- The attackers behind this campaign introduced a new Qt version of the BeaverTail malware as early as July 2024. The malware authors compiled BeaverTail variants for both Windows and macOS from the same source code using the Qt programming language.
- North Korean threat actors are known to conduct financial crimes for funds to support the DPRK regime. This campaign may be financially motivated, since the BeaverTail malware has the capability of stealing 13 different cryptocurrency wallets.

# Details

As we know, there have been social engineering and fraud campaigns on GitHub that aim to infect, steal information and cryptocurrencies from people, particularly developer accounts in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, cybersecurity, and online gambling domains.

Considering that it is a known vector, this brief investigation only seeks to highlight a possible network of false recruiters that includes the use of social engineering on LinkedIn

# Key:

- User “Onder Kayabasi” is Premiun in LinkedIn and is actively sending malware using his facade as recruiter
- We could see some new recruitment accounts which are only followed by 2 accounts “devmaster929” and “sammorozov”
- We don´t know why “Devmaster929” and Sam Morozov are following that big amount of accounts and why.
- We don’t understand the reasons behind “Devmaster929” and “Sam Morozov” following such a large number of accounts.
- It is not a crime to follow accounts on GitHub; however, the number of accounts followed that are related to recruiters, with accounts less than 6 months old, only 2 followers, similar descriptions, no repositories, mostly female profiles, users with fake and some real links, is not a coincidence.
- There are accounts who mixed real links with fake information
- There are GitHub accounts linked to weird LinkedIn profiles with only “repost” acvitity
- There are more new accounts in GitHub and most of them follow the same pattern of Bio, creation date, followed by, job as recruiters, LinkedIn link, and other things that are not a coincidence.
- The excel list shared here, are user who follow certain pattern regarding what seems to be suspicious, howevere there a few accounts that we cannot determine if they are fake or real.
- GitHub recently issued a security alert warning of a social engineering campaign targeting developer accounts in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, cybersecurity, and online gambling domains.
