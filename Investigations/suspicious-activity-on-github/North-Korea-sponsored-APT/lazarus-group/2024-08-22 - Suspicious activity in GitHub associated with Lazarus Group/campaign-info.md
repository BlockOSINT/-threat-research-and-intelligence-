# Suspicious activity in GitHub associated with Lazarus Group

# Investigation

Investigating the suspicious activity in GitHub associated with the Lazarus Group, targeting developers and companies. The findings were published on Medium

The aim of this investigation was to demonstrate that there is activity on GitHub associated with websites for these profiles, which seek to gain greater credibility. Additionally, this investigation revealed information that was not published in the second Medium article.

Additionally, this investigation highlights the activity of several interconnected accounts on GitHub that appear to be organized in relation to Lazarus's activities. These accounts follow one another, creating a network with shared characteristics, including similar bios, profile images, and skills.

The accounts listed here are part of an investigation into malicious actors on GitHub. Much of this activity, related to fake recruiters and employees, has been primarily associated with the Lazarus Group.

- Most accounts were manually scraped, with specific characteristics filtered, such as:

- Creation date: account creation, repo activity, (Many of these accounts have been created at the end of 2023)

- Follow/Follower: these accounts follow each other like a network, following "node" type accounts

- Suspicious repository activity: "forker", "stars other empty profiles", identical repositories, same "projects"

- Bio: many of these profiles have similar descriptions: "Full Stack developer" "+5 years experience" , broken social network links

- Skills: most common skills are "Full Stack Blockchain Developer", " full-stack software engineer", "AI / ML Engineer" "Senior AI & Full Stack Developer"

- Social networks: LinkedIn account with no activity/like activity, fake github profiles linked to real accounts, suspicious instagram/facebook, no recent social activity

- Context: Accounts with broken links, github stats, AI-generated images, profiles in Latin America with an Asian appearance, accounts with no history

- Logical pattern: activity not related to account, knowledge scope, skill-set

- Association: Is this account on other social networks? Or from companies that hire like: up work? Do associated accounts do freelance?

This investigation is part of a series of investigations into suspicious activity on GitHub and LinkedIn involving recruiters and developers that is generally related to tactics and methods attributed to the Lazarus Group

The first investigation we tracked an account linked to a Fake recruiter in LinkedIn, who is confirmed have approached developers sending malware and was pointed out for this. A network of fake recruiters was observerd linked to these accounts involved in this activity.

The second investigation we tracked the same account and after some findings it was determined that some of the tactics and methods were related to the same tactics and methods used by hackers such as Lazarus and some of the campaigns related to them.

In this investigation we track the same account and others related to understand the network of accounts related to suspcious activity on GitHub. Many of the findings from this new investigation confirm the high possibility that this fraudulent activity on GitHub is related to Lazarus.

 

# Key:

- The information suggests the existence of a network of GitHub accounts, where some function as nodes for collecting information, while others are used primarily to boost follower counts on targeted profiles.
- In some cases, these “developers” go as far as creating their own websites to enhance their credibility and appear more convincing to potential employers.
- Much of this fraudulent activity, involving fake recruiters and developers, is linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored cyber threat organization.
- Certain accounts seem to operate within a structured hierarchy. This is evidenced by profiles with higher activity levels also displaying a greater number of followers and followed accounts, indicating a coordinated effort.
- The campaign appears to be organized with specific roles: some accounts act as nodes, others primarily follow developers, some focus on following companies, and certain accounts exclusively follow female profiles. This suggests a high level of organization and control within the campaign.
- The network of fake profiles is extensive, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent accounts. The blending of real and false information, coupled with frequent redirects to legitimate profiles, contributes to the deceptive nature of this network.
